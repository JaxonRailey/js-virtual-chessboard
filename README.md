This repository contains a virtual chessboard implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chessboard is designed not for traditional gameplay, as pieces can be freely moved, and there is no specific order of play. Instead, it serves as an educational tool, allowing users to simulate different chess positions and scenarios.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The chessboard is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices.
- **Piece Movement**: Users can move chess pieces freely across the board.
- **Move Validation**: Clicking on a piece highlights the squares to which it could potentially move, ignoring any obstructing pieces.
- **Right-Click Selection**: Right-clicking on a square selects it, providing additional functionality.
